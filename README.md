# Explain My LeetCode

Explain My LeetCode is a backend system that helps DSA learners understand *why* their LeetCode solutions fail.

Instead of providing answers, it safely executes user-submitted Python solutions against curated edge cases and reports failure reasons and complexity insights.

## Current Status
🚧 Project is under active development.

## Planned Features
- Safe execution of user Python code
- Curated LeetCode problem templates
- Edge case detection
- Failure analysis without using LLMs
